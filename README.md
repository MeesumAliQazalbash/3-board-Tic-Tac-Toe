# 3-board-Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a more complex Tic Tac Toe with advance problems. Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h09XU8t8eUM.

1. There are 3 boards, each of 3 by 3 dimension.
2. There will be only one variable to mark a move, which is "X".
3. You are free to mark on any board at any position, until or unless it is occupied.
4. If there is a configuration on a board which shows three Xs are line up either in rows, column or diagonals, the board will be consider dead.
5. Dead board will not take part in the game ahead.
6. One who kills the last board is the winner.
